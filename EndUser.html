<h2>Setting Up Your Device</h2>
<A NAME="ReceiverDrivers">
<h3>Installing Drivers for USB</h3>
<p>
&nbsp1. Plug the receiver into your computer via USB.<br>
&nbsp2. If Windows prompts you that the device drivers failed to install, download the appropriate drivers at <A HREF=”http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm”>USB Receiver Drivers</a>. At this point, Windows should recognize the device.
</p>
<A NAME="InstallandRun">
<h3>Installing Adobe Air and Running Program</h3>
<p>
&nbsp1. Install Adobe Air by following the instructions at the <A HREF=”http://get.adobe.com/air/”>Adobe</a> installation site.<br>
&nbsp2. Double click on ActiMo.swf file from the GitHub Folder and the application should launch within Adobe air. (NOTE: If it does not, you may need to change the file association by right-clicking and using the Open With.... command) <br>
&nbsp3. Install python by following the instructions at <A HREF=”http://docs.python.org/2/install/”>Python 2.7.5 release</a>. This will require some knowledge of command prompt. 
</p>
<A NAME="PrepUsage">
<h3>Preparing for Usage</h3>
<p>
&nbsp1. Simply flip the power switch on the top face of the ActiMo device to begin transmitting data to the computer.<br>
2. Point the ActiMo at the screen from roughly where the child will be located. Press X on the windows remote to start the calibration while the ActiMo remains pointed at the screen.  This should only take a few seconds.<br>
3. Use the velcro strap to attach the device to the ankle or wrist with the power button opposite the contacting face and pointing towards the ground when standing in a relaxed state.

<p>
<div align="center"> A movement is being recorded</div>
Each time the game records an input from the child this icon will display in the bottom right corner.
