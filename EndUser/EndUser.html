<h2>Setting Up Your Device</h2>

<h3><a name=ReceiverDrivers>Installing Drivers for USB</a></h3>

<p>&amp;nbsp1. Plug the receiver into your computer via USB.<br>
&amp;nbsp2. If Windows prompts you that the device drivers failed to install,
download the appropriate drivers at <a
href="../../”http:/www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm”">USB Receiver Drivers</a>.
At this point, Windows should recognize the device. </p>

<h3><a name=InstallandRun>Installing Adobe Air and Running Program</a></h3>

<p>&amp;nbsp1. Install Adobe Air by following the instructions at the <a
href="../../”http:/get.adobe.com/air/”">Adobe</a> installation site.<br>
&amp;nbsp2. Double click on ActiMo.swf file from the GitHub Folder and the
application should launch within Adobe air. (NOTE: If it does not, you may need
to change the file association by right-clicking and using the Open With....
command) <br>
&amp;nbsp3. Install python by following the instructions at <a
href="../../”http:/docs.python.org/2/install/”">Python 2.7.5 release</a>. This
will require some knowledge of command prompt. </p>

<h3><a name=PrepUsage>Preparing for Usage</a></h3>

<p>&amp;nbsp1. Simply flip the power switch on the top face of the ActiMo
device to begin transmitting data to the computer.<br>
2. Point the ActiMo at the screen from roughly where the child will be located.
Press X on the windows remote to start the calibration while the ActiMo remains
pointed at the screen. This should only take a few seconds.<br>
3. Use the velcro strap to attach the device to the ankle or wrist with the
power button opposite the contacting face and pointing towards the ground when
standing in a relaxed state. </p>

<h2>Using Your Device</h2>

On this screen, you can visualize patient progress. First, choose a limb at the
top, then choose a direction of movement in the submenu on the left. </p>

<h4>Nullifying Bad Movements</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A movement is being recorded</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each time the game records an input from the child this icon
will display in the bottom right corner. If you would not like for this action
to affect the patient data progress (perhaps the movement was a bad movement
that involved heavy compensation), press button X to delete the last saved data
point. If you missed this window to delete, you can hit button Y to nullify all
data recorded up to the current point in the level. </p>

<h3><a name=Issues>Fixing Issues</a></h3>

<p><b>If on-screen movements seem incorrect...</b><br>
Power cycle ActiMo by flipping the switch off and back on. Ensure that you are
